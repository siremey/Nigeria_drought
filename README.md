# Nigeria_drought
A Personal project on Nigeria Drought Assessment using GEEMAP

The study uses NASA MODIS MOD13A2.061 Terra Vegetation Indices 16-Day Global 1km data to assess agricultural drought conditions in Nigeria for the year 2023. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and the Vegetation Condition Index (VCI) are the primary metrics under consideration. These indices are critical for measuring the health and productivity of vegetation across the country, providing information about drought severity and spatial distribution.

The study area is defined using the FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL) 2015 Country Boundaries, which provide accurate geographical boundaries for research.

Analysis and Results<br>
NDVI Analysis<br>
The [findings](Nigeria_drought_Analysis\Nigeria_drought_analysis.ipynb) show that southern Nigeria generally has high NDVI levels, indicating healthier and more robust vegetation. Northern Nigeria, especially the northeastern region, has low NDVI values. A notable exception is the Lake Chad region in northeast Borno State, which has slightly better vegetative conditions.<br>
NDVI values are highest in September (0.56) and lowest in February (0.30). A monthly NDVI trajectory shows a consistent increase from February to September, followed by a fall from September onward. This pattern provides critical data for understanding the seasonal dynamics of vegetation in Nigeria, allowing for the development of informed environmental policy.

VCI Analysis<br>
The VCI follows the NDVI trend, with values increasing from 21% in February to 76.7% in September before dropping after September. This pattern demonstrates the seasonality of the country's vegetative health.<br>
The VCI, like the NDVI, shows that southern regions enjoy reasonably wet conditions, while northern areas experience poor to extremely dry vegetation conditions.<br>

Comparing the VCI and NDVI<br>
When the NDVI and VCI are compared, they show similar tendencies, although with slight differences in their values. For example, in February 2023, the NDVI was 0.30 and the VCI was 0.20. In September, NDVI and VCI peaked at 0.56 and 0.77, respectively.<br>.

Drought Condition<br>
The study finds that 38.9% of Nigeria's geographical area is classified as extremely dry, 6.6% as severe dry, 14.2% as moderately dry, 6.8% as not dry, 12.1% as moderate wet, and 21.1% as very wet. These numbers show that more than half of the country experiences dry conditions, which pose significant risks to agricultural productivity and necessitate coordinated efforts to mitigate drought and desertification.

Conclusion and Recommendation<br>
The study emphasizes the importance of coordinated strategies targeted at improving vegetation conditions in northern Nigeria to avoid severe outcomes such as desertification and other drought-related impacts. Sustainable agricultural practices and conservation measures are critical, especially in regions with extreme wet conditions, to ensure their preservation and prevent further degradation.<br>
The findings offer a complete assessment of Nigeria's vegetation health, as well as its temporal and spatial variations. This knowledge is essential for environmental policymakers as they develop policies to combat drought and improve agricultural resilience across the country.
